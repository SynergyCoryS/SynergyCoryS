- 👋 Hi, I’m @SynergyCoryS
- 👀 I’m interested in ... making computing more like Star Trek, computers are appliances, we use them, then turn them off and go play outside
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to decouple my programs, making things easy to change
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... An invitation only library for knowledge (cooking, life hacks, etc) LCARS style - no ads, no publishing-to-publish, 
      just creating a simple data-driven, console friendly, plain text (MD?) library of information, like how long and at what temprature to roast a pumpkin, 
      without scrolling through ads, six paragraphs of 'why this is awesom', and 'did you know you could do this?', and 'look how famous I want to be for making this
      site and making you look at my ads', and scroll through 20 pages to get to "300 degrees for about 40 minutes". No ads, no profit, just sharing information.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you just did.
